# Project 1: Steepest Descent Method

Description: This sample project is aimed to show how to make a project submission. There are a few requirements about your project, this is beneficial for your later study in data science and programming. 

## Compile/Run the code

An example: In cmd(Windows) or console(Linux, Mac), type "python main.py" (" is not included) will run the code and the output is (file/in console). For MATLAB users, you can write: In MATLAB consolle, run some_project_code.m

## Contributors
This project acknowledges the following members:

- Anoymous Who
- Anoymous Anyone
- Anoymous Nobody

## Before making a submission 
Your submission should include following necessary file. 

- README.md 

The ``README.md`` file is telling user a few important things about the project. For example:

  0. Description of your project. (MUST INCLUDE)
  1. How to run/compile your code? (MUST INCLUDE)
  2. What kind of issues are known and need to be fixed? (OPTIONAL)
  3. Contributors. (MUST INCLUDE if there are multiple contributors)
  4. Todo list. (OPTIONAL)

Sometimes we also include a file called ``requirements.txt``.

The  ``requirements.txt`` usually tells user what packages are required to run the code, in optimization, we often use ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``. 

## Submission of your code
When your code is ready, make sure your code is runnable. Python users can use the platform https://repl.it/languages/python3 to test your result. Once everything is good to go, you can tar/zip ALL files and submit it.
